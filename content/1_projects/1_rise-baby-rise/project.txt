Description: [{"content":{"text":"<p>Rise Baby Rise is a celebration of our capacity to gather, in peaceful response to the restrictions on the rights to protest and gather in the UK.</p><p>In 2022 the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Act (PCSC) came into effect, and in May 2023 the Public Order Act (PO) was added. These Acts include severe restrictions on the rights to protest. The restrictions are not only for marches, they also apply to static assemblies and even one person protests. The Acts increase the risks for people participating and ask protests to happen in a way where no one is disrupted by it.</p><p>Yet, none of the successes of the Civil Rights Movement, the Suffragettes, Gay Liberation Front and Reclaim the Streets would have been achieved without civil disobedience.</p><p>Sometimes the law is wrong. With Rise Baby Rise, we invite you to take it to the streets with us.</p>"},"id":"e9246921-bb1c-434e-8bc4-f99755d738c0","isHidden":false,"type":"text"}]
