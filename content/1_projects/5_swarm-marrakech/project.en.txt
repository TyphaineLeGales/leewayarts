Description: [{"content":{"text":"<p>In December 2023, Leeway conducted research in Marrakech on how the swarm, as a club without walls, could intertwine itself with the social structure of public life in the Medina of Marrakech. Through a gradual process—initially walking the streets a few times with soft music and a small team, and engaging in conversations with shopkeepers who were present in the Medina every day—the swarm was able to temporarily become part of the daily movement of the Medina.</p>"},"id":"e4a5cb2b-4aba-4518-b568-2be8bbfd1455","isHidden":false,"type":"text"}]
