Description: [{"content":{"text":"<p>A collective dance through the city, in which we exercise our freedom of movement and our freedom of non-movement.</p><p>Ships departed and arrived, bigger ones are built to bring more and leave little behind. People sunbathing on cruise ships crossing the Mediterranean Sea, while others struggle for life in overcrowded rubber boats. Ignored calls for rescue continue, and so does the indifference to lost lives. The ones who did not drown in the water are now crushed by bureaucratic procedures on land. Between arbitrary transfers from one refugee camp to another and inhumane deportation orders, people’s freedom of movement is violated over and over again.</p><p>Freedom of (Non) Movement is part of 'Longing to Cross the Horizons’, a one-year project initiated by Hilda Moucharrafieh. It aims to pay tribute to refugees who drowned in the Mediterranean Sea, and support those who are struggling for their existence in states of limbo.</p>"},"id":"8509f379-f5c7-4e70-8937-5c19ad920d0b","isHidden":false,"type":"text"}]
